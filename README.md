# Go Websocket Game Time

This is a simple app written in Vue and Go to make playing Betrayal at House on the Hill easier for me and my friends while the pandemic is keeping us all in our houses.

Just run the following

```
cd ./src
go get github.com/gorilla/websocket
go run main.go
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8000
